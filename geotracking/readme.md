# geotracking_py
Final implementation of Senior Project's GPS tracking module.
Interfaces with an Adafruit Ultimate GPS module, via a [microcontroller](https://github.com/kmakmichael/seniorproject_mcu/tree/trunk/usb_dev_serial) that processes the data.
Tracks position according to a graph (the vertex-edge type) of UOP's campus, and is able to navigate along paths traced through this graph.
